      "1. Error Handling: The code handles the response status codes 200 and 400. It would be beneficial to add more detailed error handling for different status codes to provide more information to the user in case of any issues.\n",

      "2. Documenting Functions: Adding docstrings to describe the functions, input parameters, and expected output would help new developers understand the purpose and functionality of each function.\n",
